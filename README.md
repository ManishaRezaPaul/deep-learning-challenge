# deep-learning-challenge

In module we look at the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Step 1: Preprocess the Data
1. Determine the target and features for the model
2. Create a feature array, X, and a target array, y by using the preprocessed data
3. Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets
4. Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data

### Step 2: Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
1. Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.
3. If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
4. Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
5. Check the structure of the model.
6. Compile and train the model.

### Step 3: Optimize the Model
1. Repeat the preprocessing steps in a new Jupyter notebook 
2. Create a new neural network model, implementing at least 3 model optimization methods
